## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- NFT Observer is all about giving insights on the Freshest, Hottest & Valuable NFTs to all NFT lovers every day & hour.
- NFT space needs this feature (NFT Observer) to know about latest, most valued, high gainer, trending, and flip-able NFTs for better decision-making abilities as well as for more profits by buying and selling them.
- NFT Observer can integrate with Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama like we integrated Ethereum, Solana and Binance Smart Chain, and their NFTs.

### Project Details

- NFT Observer is and will be written in React JS, Node JS, PostgreSQL, and Strapi.
- One of the game changing feature in it will be NFTs cart, because till now not a single NFT marketplace has the feature of 'Add to cart'.
- It will help avid NFT collectors to checkout at a single time after adding collections and different kind of NFTs into their carts.
- Right now, a person can only purchase a single NFT at a time, and needs to repeat the whole process again to purchase another one.

### Ecosystem Fit


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
NFT Observer fits into the ecosystem in a unique way to bring as many NFTs as possible to a single platform, of different blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain and Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our initial target audience is rarity.tools, solanart.io and solanalysis.com userbase as well as our own userbase.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
NFT Observer meets the needs of NFT traders who require the insightful statistics about the NFTs from as many blockchains as possible in one place.
To make better understanding and decision-making regarding buying and selling of non-fungible tokens, NFT Observer is a key requisite for it.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
There are no other projects handling this NFTs flipping and statistics area. Because we are constantly expanding our approach in terms of blockchains and parachains, like NFT Observer is now amplifying towards Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.
