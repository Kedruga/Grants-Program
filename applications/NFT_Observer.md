## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- NFT Observer is all about giving insights on the Freshest, Hottest & Valuable NFTs to all NFT lovers every day & hour.
- NFT space needs this feature (NFT Observer) to know about latest, most valued, high gainer, trending, and flip-able NFTs for better decision-making abilities as well as for more profits by buying and selling them.
- NFT Observer can integrate with Kusama like we integrated Ethereum, Solana and Binance Smart Chain, and their NFTs.

### Project Details

- NFT Observer is and will be written in React JS, Node JS, PostgreSQL, and Strapi.
- NFT Observer is simply a single page website which showcase NFTs in two categories:
 HOTTEST OF THE HOUR (Premium category)
 FRESHEST OF THE DAY (Free category)
- For any NFT project who wants to get listed in our first category, they need to provide a little information about their project and have to complete the payment according to their NFT blockchain by switching the Chain option.
- For any NFT project who wants to get listed in our second category, they can either contact us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/observernft) or we are constantly searching for blue chip projects that could be beneficial for investors to flip.
- We only list projects that have good stats in a given day or hour, and when a day or hour ends we remove that project and list new ones, as we are expanding our team we will be more active to search and list projects regularly. We've a dedicated Strapi CMS through which our team can CRUD the NFT projects.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
NFT Observer fits into the ecosystem in a unique way to bring as many NFTs as possible to a single platform, of different blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain and Kusama.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's user base, yourself)?
Our initial target audience is rarity.tools, solanart.io and solanalysis.com user base as well as our own user base.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
NFT Observer meets the needs of NFT traders who require insightful statistics about the NFTs from as many blockchains as possible in one place.
To make better understanding and decision-making regarding buying and selling of non-fungible tokens, NFT Observer is a key requisite for it.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
There are no other projects handling this NFTs flipping and statistics area. Because we are constantly expanding our approach in terms of blockchains and parachains, like NFT Observer is now amplifying towards the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.
